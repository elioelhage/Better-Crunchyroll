# Better Crunchyroll

**Version 0.2.20** keeps the v2.18 player and button behavior intact and adds a safe, CSS-only episode-list layout change.

## What it does
- Preserves the native Crunchyroll player skin in fullscreen.
- Keeps the v2.18 Back button and other player controls unchanged.
- Shows the current episode title in the player controls.
- Adds an episode-list control styled to fit the native player.
- Moves **Continue Watching** directly below **Trending in Canada** on the Discover page.
- Uses the Better Crunchyroll artwork with colored/grayscale icon states and no ON/OFF badge.
- Includes a compact popup with the extension logo, enable/disable switch, and version footer.
- Changes only the native `erc-playable-collection state-dt-condensed` episode grid into a vertical list inside the real `erc-episode-list-modal`.
- Keeps Crunchyroll's episode DOM intact: no sorting, cloning, reparenting, or card movement is performed in v2.20.
- Uses smaller left-side thumbnails with episode information on the right.
- Retains the existing extension-off cleanup behavior.
